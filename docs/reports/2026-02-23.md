### Google Banning OpenClaw Users — First Platform War Erupts
Google is mass-restricting Google AI Pro/Ultra subscribers ($250/mo) who used OpenClaw to route requests through Google's "Antigravity" backend. The story exploded on HN (#1 with 657 pts, 551+ comments). Google employee confirmed: "massive increase in malicious usage of the Antigravity backend that has tremendously degraded quality of service." Users report bans lasting 11+ days with no restoration path. $250/mo customers told "we are unable to reverse the suspension." Key concern: Workspace accounts potentially nuked if an employee connected Gemini to OpenClaw. Community furious about lack of rate-limiting vs. blanket bans.

- HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47115805
- **Why it matters:** First real conflict between AI providers and the Claw orchestration ecosystem. Signals providers will start restricting third-party orchestration tools. Direct relevance to anyone using OpenClaw with Google AI services.

## 🟠 Major Signals

### 1. Ladybird Browser Adopts Rust — AI-Powered Migration as Proof of Concept
The Ladybird browser project announced adopting Rust, using Claude Code + Codex for the translation. Developer ported 25,000 lines of C++ to Rust in ~2 weeks (vs. months by hand). "Human-directed, not autonomous code generation... hundreds of small prompts, steering the agents." Byte-for-byte identical output verified against C++ pipeline. All test262 tests passing.
- Source: https://ladybird.org/posts/adopting-rust/
- HN: 136 pts (rising fast)
- **Why it matters:** Most credible public case study of AI-assisted large-scale language migration. Proves the "centaur" model at significant scale — human decides what/when, AI executes the translation.

### 2. JFrog Tumbles 25% After Claude Code Security Launch
JFrog stock dropped ~25% after Anthropic launched security scanning capabilities directly within Claude Code, competing with JFrog's core software composition analysis business.
- Source: Globes (Israel Business News) via Google News RSS
- **Why it matters:** AI coding tools are vertically integrating security. If Claude Code eats JFrog's market, expect similar disruption across the dev toolchain (testing, deployment, monitoring). The "AI IDE as platform" thesis accelerates.

### 3. Axios: AI's "Centaur Phase" Consumes Silicon Valley
Axios coined the term "centaur phase" — the human-AI collaboration model where humans steer and AI executes, named after chess centaurs. Silicon Valley is reorganizing around this paradigm.
- Source: Axios via Google News RSS
- **Why it matters:** The naming matters. "Centaur" is becoming the standard mental model for how technical founders should think about AI collaboration — not replacement, but augmentation with human direction.

### 4. Theo: "Delete your CLAUDE.md (and your AGENT.md too)"
Theo (t3.gg) published a contrarian video arguing the meta-prompt file convention (CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, CURSORRULES) has become cargo cult programming. Suggests more targeted, dynamic context engineering instead of static prompt files.
- Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcNu6wrLTJc
- Published: Feb 23, 2026
- **Why it matters:** Signals the community is maturing past "dump everything in a system prompt file." Context engineering (what goes in, what stays out, when) is the real skill. Directly relevant to how we structure our own AGENTS.md.

### 5. Pentagon AI Power Struggle After Deadly Raid
The Washington Post reports an internal power struggle at the Pentagon over AI deployment following a deadly raid. Different factions fighting over AI's role in military operations.
- Source: Washington Post via Google News RSS
- **Why it matters:** Government AI adoption hitting real friction points. The military-AI nexus is where the biggest compute and safety questions converge.

## 🔬 Research Frontier

### Papers (arXiv, Feb 23 2026)

1. **APEMO: Peak-Aware Orchestration for Long-Horizon Agentic Systems** (2602.17910)
   Runtime scheduling layer that optimizes compute allocation across agent trajectories. Uses "temporal-affective signals" to detect instability and target repairs at critical moments. "Reframes alignment as a temporal control problem." → Relevant for long-running coding agents and multi-step workflows.

2. **WorkflowPerturb: Calibrated Stress Tests for Multi-Agent Workflows** (2602.17990)
   Benchmark with 4,973 golden workflows and 44,757 perturbed variants. Tests Missing Steps, Compressed Steps, and Description Changes at 10/30/50% severity. First systematic evaluation framework for workflow degradation. → Essential for anyone building production agent pipelines.

3. **Logitext: Neurosymbolic Language Reasoning as SMT** (2602.18095)
   First system treating LLM-based reasoning as an SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theory) theory. Combines LLMs with formal solvers for partially-structured documents. Improves both accuracy and coverage on content moderation and legal benchmarks. → Novel approach for structured document analysis.

4. **Thinking by Subtraction: Confidence-Driven Contrastive Decoding** (2602.18232)
   Detects low-confidence tokens during decoding and intervenes selectively. Constructs contrastive reference by replacing high-confidence tokens with placeholders. Improves accuracy while reducing token usage. → Practical technique for cheaper, more reliable LLM reasoning.

5. **ELIA: Explainable Language Interpretability Analysis** (2602.18262)
   Interactive web app using VLMs to auto-generate natural language explanations for mechanistic interpretability visualizations. User study shows AI explanations bridge the knowledge gap for non-experts. → Making model internals accessible to builders.

6. **OMAD: Online Multi-Agent Diffusion Policies** (2602.18291)
   First online MARL framework using diffusion models for multi-agent coordination. Key innovation: relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy without tractable likelihood. → Relevant for multi-agent systems where coordination is key.

### Emerging Community Ideas

- **Context Engineering > Prompt Engineering:** The shift from "write better prompts" to "manage the full context window" is crystallizing. Muratcankoylan's Agent Skills repo (8,629★) is now cited in academic papers. Theo's "Delete your CLAUDE.md" video pushes the same theme from the practitioner side.
- **Always-On Agent Memory:** memU (9,879★) and similar projects show the community converging on hierarchical, file-system-like memory for persistent agents. Token cost reduction for 24/7 agents is a key unsolved problem.
- **Agent Messaging Protocols:** Aqua (P2P encrypted) and Pantalk (multi-platform) signal that agent-to-agent communication is becoming its own infrastructure layer, separate from human messaging.
