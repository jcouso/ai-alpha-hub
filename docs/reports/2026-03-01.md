# AI Alpha Report — 2026-03-01

## TL;DR
- **Anthropic declared "supply chain risk" by Pentagon** — Trump bans all govt use, OpenAI swoops same-day defense deal. Claude hits #1 on App Store as consumer protest. AI companies are now geopolitical actors.
- **Claude Code CVEs disclosed** (CVE-2025-59536, CVE-2026-21852) — RCE + API token exfiltration via malicious project files. Fixed, but the attack surface is real: agent config files are the new `.env`.
- **DeepSeek V4 launching next week** — multimodal (image/video/text), withheld from Nvidia/AMD, gave Huawei early access. China's AI sovereignty play is accelerating.
- **Google API keys now silently expose Gemini data** — thousands of public keys can authenticate to Gemini endpoints. If you use Google Cloud, audit NOW.
- **GitHub trending is all agent infra** — ruflo (928★/day), memU (338★/day), superset IDE (181★/day), wifi-densepose. The agent infrastructure gold rush is peaking.

## 🧭 Narrative Radar

1. **AI companies are geopolitical actors now.** The Anthropic/Pentagon standoff is a watershed: a frontier AI lab refused to guarantee unrestricted military use, got blacklisted, and consumers rallied behind it. OpenAI took the opposite bet. This isn't tech news — it's power politics. Every AI company now has to pick a side on autonomous weapons.

2. **Agent security is the new attack surface.** Three independent security events this week — Claude Code CVEs, Google API keys → Gemini, MCP adoption outpacing security controls. The pattern is clear: the same config files and API keys that make agent workflows easy are now the #1 vector for supply-chain attacks on dev tools.

3. **The agent infrastructure gold rush.** GitHub trending is wall-to-wall agent orchestration: ruflo, deer-flow, memU, superset, OpenSandbox. We're in the "picks and shovels" phase where everyone is building the plumbing for multi-agent systems. The consolidation winners will emerge in the next 60 days.

**Counter-narrative emerging:** Boris Cherny (Claude Code creator) and Theo (t3.gg) are both raising flags about fundamental problems with current coding agents. The "vibe coding" honeymoon is ending; the narrative is shifting toward "how do we actually make these reliable?"

## 🚀 Top Early Moves (CONFIRMED, last 24h)

### 1) Anthropic blacklisted, Claude hits #1 on App Store
- Trump directed all federal agencies to cease using Anthropic products. Defense Sec. Hegseth labeled Anthropic a "supply chain risk to national security" after negotiations broke down over autonomous weapons and surveillance restrictions. Hours later, OpenAI announced its own Pentagon deal for classified systems. Claude surged to #1 on the App Store as users boycotted ChatGPT.
- Why it matters: the competitive dynamics of frontier AI are now inseparable from government contracts and ethics positioning. If you're building on these APIs, your vendor's political exposure is now a business risk.

### 2) Claude Code CVEs: RCE + API token exfiltration via project config files
- Check Point Research disclosed CVE-2025-59536 and CVE-2026-21852 — attackers can achieve remote code execution and steal Anthropic API keys through malicious `.claude/settings.json`, Hooks, and MCP server configs. Fixed in v2.0.65 but the attack vector (poisoned repos) remains relevant for any coding agent.
- Why it matters: anyone cloning untrusted repos with Claude Code (or any agent) needs a pre-run security scan. Agent config files are the new attack surface.

### 3) DeepSeek V4 imminent — multimodal, withheld from US chipmakers
- FT reports DeepSeek will release V4 next week — a multimodal model with image, video, and text generation. Crucially, DeepSeek denied Nvidia and AMD pre-release optimization access while granting Huawei and domestic Chinese chipmakers a multi-week window. First major model to intentionally exclude Western chip optimization.
- Why it matters: this is a parallel AI ecosystem forming on non-Western silicon. If V4 benchmarks well on Huawei chips, it changes the calculus for self-hosted AI outside the US.

### 4) Google API keys silently expose Gemini AI data
- Truffle Security found ~3,000 public Google Cloud API keys (the `AIza` prefix ones embedded in client-side code for Maps etc.) can now authenticate to Gemini endpoints when the Generative Language API is enabled on the project. Attackers can access uploaded files, cached data, and charge LLM usage.
- Why it matters: if you've ever enabled Gemini API on a Google Cloud project with existing public API keys, those keys are now secrets. Audit immediately.

### 5) Claude Code ships Remote Control, Auto Memory, and Plugins
- Claude Code's latest updates: **Remote Control** (native mobile streaming for controlling sessions from your phone), **Auto Memory** (automatically saves useful context to MEMORY.md), `/copy` picker for code blocks, smarter bash prefixes, and a Plugins system.
- Why it matters: Remote Control turns Claude Code into a mobile-controlled agent. Auto Memory means less manual context management. Plugins open the extension ecosystem.

### 6) GitHub Copilot coding agent: model picker, self-review, security scanning, CLI handoff
- GitHub shipped a wave of Copilot coding agent features: choose your model per task, built-in self-review before PR, automated security scanning, custom agent definitions, and CLI handoff for terminal workflows. Plus mobile live notifications to track agent progress.
- Why it matters: Copilot is evolving from "autocomplete" to a full agentic platform. The model picker alone means you can route expensive tasks to Opus and cheap tasks to a faster model.

## 🧪 Research Frontier

- **GPT-5 and frontier LLMs lose up to 33% accuracy in long conversations.** The Decoder reports on new research showing that extended chat sessions degrade model performance significantly — even for the latest frontier models. Practical implication: for complex multi-step agent tasks, resetting context periodically beats endless conversation threads.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Tips

### 1) Scan repos for malicious agent config files before running coding agents
The Claude Code CVEs showed that `.claude/settings.json`, Hooks, and MCP configs can execute arbitrary shell commands. Add this to your pre-clone workflow:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# agent-config-audit.sh — scan a repo for risky agent config patterns
set -euo pipefail

REPO_DIR="${1:-.}"
RISKY_PATTERNS='(curl |wget |bash -c|python -c|rm -rf|eval |nc |/dev/tcp|base64 -d)'

echo "🔍 Scanning $REPO_DIR for risky agent config files..."

find "$REPO_DIR" -type f \( \
  -path "*/.claude/*" \
  -o -name "AGENTS.md" \
  -o -name "CLAUDE.md" \
  -o -name ".mcp.json" \
  -o -name "mcp_config.json" \
  -o -path "*/.cursor/*" \
  -o -name "SKILL.md" \
\) -exec grep -lEn "$RISKY_PATTERNS" {} + 2>/dev/null && {
  echo "⚠️  RISKY PATTERNS FOUND — review before running any coding agent"
  exit 1
} || echo "✅ No risky patterns detected"
```

### 2) Audit your Google Cloud projects for Gemini API exposure
If you've ever enabled the Generative Language API, your existing API keys may now authenticate to Gemini:

```bash
# List all API keys in your GCP project and check for Gemini API enablement
gcloud services list --enabled --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID | grep -i generativelanguage

# If enabled, list and rotate any public-facing API keys
gcloud services api-keys list --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --format='table(uid,displayName,restrictions.apiTargets)'

# Restrict keys to only the services they need
gcloud services api-keys update KEY_ID \
  --api-target=service=maps-backend.googleapis.com
```

## ⚙️ Workflow Upgrades

1. **Add an agent config audit step to your CI.** After the Claude Code CVEs, any repo with `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, or hook configs should be scanned before agent execution. The script above is a starting point — add it as a pre-commit hook or CI step.

2. **Use Claude Code's new Auto Memory strategically.** It auto-saves context to MEMORY.md, but you should curate it. After each session: review what Auto Memory captured, prune noise, promote durable decisions. The GPT-5 long-context accuracy research suggests shorter, well-contextualized sessions beat marathon ones — Auto Memory helps you reset cleanly between sessions.

---

## 🎯 Action Pack (today)

1. **Run the agent config audit script** on your top 3 repos. Check for any `.claude/`, `.mcp.json`, or hook files with shell execution patterns. Takes 2 minutes.

2. **Audit your Google Cloud API keys** if you use GCP. Check if Generative Language API is enabled; restrict any public-facing keys that shouldn't reach Gemini.

3. **Test Claude Code Remote Control** — connect from your phone to a running Claude Code session. If you're already using Claude Code daily, this changes how you interact with long-running agent tasks.

4. **Explore ruflo (ruvnet/ruflo)** — agent orchestration for Claude with distributed swarm intelligence. 928 stars/day on GitHub. Worth a 30-minute spike to understand the architecture.

5. **Watch Theo's "BIG problem" video** and compare your own experience with coding agents. Useful calibration for where to trust agents vs where to stay hands-on.
