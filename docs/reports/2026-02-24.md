## 🔥 Top 10 Signals

### 1. Superpowers Explodes — 59,929 Stars, 1,500★/Day, #1 on GitHub 🚀🔥
**Score: 9.5/10** | CONFIRMED | GitHub #1 trending

obra/superpowers — an agentic skills framework and complete software development methodology — rocketed to #1 on GitHub trending with an astonishing 59,929 total stars and 1,500 new stars/day. This is the single fastest adoption of an agentic coding framework we've tracked.

**What it does:**
- Complete dev workflow: brainstorming → spec → git worktrees → TDD → subagent-driven development → code review → merge
- Skills trigger automatically — your coding agent "just has superpowers"
- Works across Claude Code (`/plugin install`), Cursor (`/plugin-add`), Codex, OpenCode
- Enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR TDD, YAGNI, and DRY as mandatory workflows, not suggestions
- Subagent-driven development: spawns fresh subagents per task with two-stage review (spec compliance, then code quality)
- Claude can work autonomously "for a couple hours at a time without deviating from the plan"

**Why this is the #1 story:** This repo resolves the "Delete your CLAUDE.md" vs "structure everything" debate from yesterday. The answer: composable, community-maintained skills that install in one command and enforce best practices automatically. 59K stars in days means the developer community has decided that structured agentic workflows are the way forward — they just want them to be effortless to adopt.

### 2. DeepSeek Trained on Nvidia's Best Chip Despite US Ban — Reuters Exclusive 🇨🇳🔥
**Score: 9.5/10** | CONFIRMED | Reuters, Seeking Alpha, Yahoo Finance, CNBC, Futurism

Reuters broke an exclusive: China's DeepSeek trained its upcoming AI model on Nvidia's most advanced chip, despite the US export ban. A government official confirmed the finding.

**What this means:**
- Export controls are failing to prevent access to cutting-edge AI hardware
- DeepSeek's upcoming model (imminent release per CNBC) was trained on banned chips
- Market reaction: CNBC reports "a rough period for Nasdaq stocks could follow" when the model drops
- Futurism headline: "American AI Industry Trembles as DeepSeek Prepares to Release New Model"

**Why this matters for builders:** If DeepSeek releases a model competitive with GPT-5/Claude Opus trained on smuggled chips, it validates that (a) export controls don't work and (b) the open-weight ecosystem is about to get much more competitive. The pricing pressure on commercial API providers would intensify.

### 3. Simon Willison: "Writing Code Is Cheap Now" + Agentic Engineering Patterns 📝🔥
**Score: 9.0/10** | CONFIRMED | simonwillison.net, HN at 214 points

Simon Willison — arguably the most influential voice in practical AI developer tooling — published a landmark post and announced a new project: documenting "Agentic Engineering Patterns."

**Key thesis:**
> "The biggest challenge in adopting agentic engineering practices is getting comfortable with the consequences of the fact that writing code is cheap now."
> "Code has always been expensive. Many of our engineering habits, at both the macro and micro level, are built around this core constraint."

He argues that with coding agents, the entire software engineering discipline needs to evolve — from planning, to estimation, to feature evaluation, to code review practices.

**Why this matters:** Simon's framing + obra/superpowers trending = the practitioner community is converging on a new software engineering paradigm. Not "vibe coding" (that's the amateur version). This is "agentic engineering" — a disciplined methodology where humans direct, agents execute, and the workflow enforces quality automatically.

### 4. FreeBSD Wi-Fi Driver Built by AI — HN #1 at 385 Points 🖥️🔥
**Score: 8.5/10** | CONFIRMED | HN #1, vladimir.varank.in

A developer got AI to build a working Wi-Fi driver for FreeBSD on an old MacBook — a piece of systems programming that would typically require deep kernel expertise and weeks of work.

This lands alongside yesterday's Ladybird Rust port (1,191 pts, still on HN front page) to form a clear pattern: AI coding agents are now credibly tackling systems-level programming, not just web apps.

**Why this matters:** The objection "AI can only do toy projects" is dying fast. In one week: a JS engine ported to Rust (Ladybird), COBOL modernization crashing IBM stock, and now a kernel Wi-Fi driver. The frontier of what coding agents can do is expanding into the most specialized domains.

### 5. IBM Crash Deepens: "Steepest Daily Drop Since 2000" — 13% Down 📉🔥
**Score: 9.0/10** | CONFIRMED | Reuters, CNBC, Bloomberg, Times of India, Sherwood, Fortune, Forrester

The IBM story from yesterday intensified. Updated headlines:
- **Reuters:** "IBM posts steepest daily drop since 2000 after Anthropic says AI can modernize COBOL"
- **CNBC:** "IBM is the latest AI casualty. Shares tank 13%"
- **Fortune:** "IBM gets a taste of the Anthropic treatment (or, vibe coding panic comes for the Cobol cowboys)"
- **Forrester:** "Claude Code Security Causes A SaaS-pocalypse In Cybersecurity"

Cybersecurity stocks also selling off. Wedbush calls it an overreaction (Yahoo Finance).

**Why this matters:** This is now the single largest stock crash directly attributable to an AI coding agent's capabilities. The market is pricing in AI agents as existential threats to established tech services. First COBOL maintenance, next: cybersecurity SaaS. Forrester's "SaaS-pocalypse" label is significant — they're an enterprise analyst firm, not a hype outlet.

### 6. Theo: "Anthropic Is Lying to Us" — Fresh Today 🎬🔥
**Score: 8.5/10** | CONFIRMED | YouTube, Feb 24, 07:34 UTC

Theo (t3.gg) dropped his second provocative AI video in two days. Yesterday: "Delete your CLAUDE.md." Today: "Anthropic is lying to us." This likely challenges Anthropic's distillation attack claims from Sunday.

**Context:** Anthropic's Sunday blog post accused Chinese labs of systematically stealing Claude's capabilities via distillation. Theo's counter-take — from one of the most-watched dev YouTubers — signals that the practitioner community isn't taking Anthropic's claims at face value.

**Why this matters:** The narrative battle between AI labs is playing out in real-time through practitioner influencers. If developers lose trust in Anthropic's claims, it impacts the broader competitive dynamic. Watch for the community response.

### 7. "Car Wash" Test — The Simplest Benchmark Most Models Fail 🧪🔥
**Score: 8.5/10** | CONFIRMED | opper.ai, HN at 254 points

A devastatingly simple reasoning test went viral: "I want to wash my car. The car wash is 50 meters away. Should I walk or drive?" 42 out of 53 models said "walk." Only the car needs to be at the car wash.

**10-run consistency results (10/10 = reliable):**
- ✅ Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 3 Pro, Grok-4
- ⚠️ GPT-5: only 7/10 (fails 30% of the time)
- ❌ All Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek models: failed
- 🤡 Perplexity Sonar: right answer for completely wrong reasons (EPA emissions data)

**Why this matters:** This is the anti-benchmark benchmark. It reveals that high scores on academic benchmarks don't translate to reliable common-sense reasoning. For builders deploying AI in production: if GPT-5 can't reliably answer a trivial logic question, how much do you trust it on complex agentic tasks? The answer: always have verification loops (which is exactly what Superpowers enforces).

### 8. Steerling-8B: First Inherently Interpretable LLM — Show HN 🧠
**Score: 8.0/10** | CONFIRMED | Show HN at 190 points, guidelabs.ai

Guide Labs (PhDs from MIT, UMD, MILA) launched Steerling-8B — the first language model that can explain which part of the prompt is responsible for each token it generates. This is inherent interpretability, not post-hoc attribution.

**Why this matters:** The interpretability problem is one of the biggest blockers for AI deployment in regulated industries. If you can point to exactly which input caused which output, you get auditability for free. This is early (8B parameters) but the research direction — building models that are interpretable by design rather than analyzed after the fact — is potentially transformative.

### 9. xAI Grok Gets Pentagon Deal for Classified Systems ⚔️
**Score: 8.0/10** | CONFIRMED | Axios, Teslarati

Musk's xAI and the Pentagon reached a deal to use Grok in classified systems. This alongside yesterday's Hegseth/Anthropic CEO meeting means the Pentagon is now actively onboarding multiple AI providers.

**The Pentagon AI landscape (as of this week):**
- **xAI/Grok:** Deal signed for classified systems
- **Anthropic/Claude:** CEO summoned for "tough talks" about military use
- **Microsoft/OpenAI:** Existing DoD relationships
- **Palantir:** Established AI platform

**Why this matters:** Defense is becoming the next major AI revenue vertical. The fact that both xAI and Anthropic are being brought in — despite very different approaches to safety — suggests the Pentagon wants competitive options and is moving fast.

### 10. Anthropic Research: "The Persona Selection Model" — Why AI Acts Human 🧬
**Score: 7.5/10** | CONFIRMED | anthropic.com/research, Feb 23

Anthropic published a significant alignment research paper explaining why AI assistants behave in human-like ways. Key insight: during pretraining, models learn to simulate "personas" — characters from text. Post-training then selects which persona to amplify. You're not talking to the AI itself — you're talking to a character in an AI-generated story.

**Why this matters for builders:** If you're building products with AI, understanding that your users are interacting with a "persona" (not a mind) changes how you design interfaces, set expectations, and handle edge cases. The paper also has implications for the CLAUDE.md debate: context engineering is literally shaping which persona your agent embodies.

## 🧪 Research Frontier

### Agentic Engineering Becomes a Discipline
Three independent signals converged this week to define a new software engineering paradigm:
1. **Simon Willison's "Agentic Engineering Patterns"** — Formal documentation of coding practices for the agent era
2. **obra/superpowers at 60K stars** — A complete, installable implementation of these patterns
3. **HuggingFace Skills at 4,585 stars** (Day 3, still 1,451/day) — Cross-platform skill format gaining ecosystem adoption

The pattern: human-directed intent → agent-executed implementation → automated quality gates → verified output. This is NOT vibe coding — it's the disciplined version.

### Inherent Interpretability in Foundation Models
Steerling-8B (Guide Labs, Show HN 190 pts) represents a fundamental shift from post-hoc interpretability to built-in transparency. If scaled, this changes the game for AI auditing, regulation compliance, and debugging. The team's track record (24+ papers at top ML conferences, first interpretable diffusion model) suggests this is credible early-stage research, not vaporware.

### The Persona Theory of AI Assistants
Anthropic's "persona selection model" paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding why AI behaves as it does. Core claim: pretraining creates a vast "space of possible personas," and post-training narrows which personas are expressed. This has direct implications for prompt engineering, system prompt design, and the entire context engineering movement.

### Use the Car Wash Test as a Model Sanity Check
Before deploying a model in production, run it through a few "trivially obvious to humans" tests:
- Car wash test: "I want to wash my car. The car wash is 50 meters away. Should I walk or drive?"
- Only 5 models pass reliably: Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Flash/Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, Grok-4
