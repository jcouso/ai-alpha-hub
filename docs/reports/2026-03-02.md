# AI Alpha Report — 2026-03-02

## TL;DR
- **US military used Claude in Iran strikes hours after Trump banned it** — WSJ confirms Pentagon relied on Anthropic's AI during Saturday's Iran operation, even as Hegseth's blacklist order was still being processed. AI vendor lock-in is now a national security dependency.
- **Hackers weaponized Claude Code to breach 10 Mexican government agencies** — 150GB exfiltrated including 195M taxpayer records. First confirmed nation-state-level cyberattack using an AI coding agent as primary tooling.
- **ClawJacked: malicious websites can hijack local OpenClaw agents via WebSocket** — Plus 71 malicious ClawHub skills distributing Atomic Stealer malware. Patched, but if you run OpenClaw, update NOW.
- **GPT-5.4 accidentally leaked in Codex demo** — OpenAI employee's screen share showed GPT-5.4 in the model selector. No official announcement, but it confirms the next iteration is in internal testing.
- **Alibaba's OpenSandbox hits 1,179 stars/day** — Production-ready sandbox platform for AI agent code execution. Docker/K8s runtimes for coding agents, GUI agents, and RL training.

## 🧭 Narrative Radar

1. **AI as geopolitical infrastructure is no longer theoretical.** The US military continued using Claude for Iran strike planning *hours after* the President banned it. This isn't a policy argument anymore — it's proof that frontier AI has become so embedded in military operations that even a direct presidential order can't be cleanly executed in real-time. Every AI company is now critical infrastructure whether they want to be or not.

2. **AI-assisted cyberattacks have crossed the nation-state threshold.** The Mexico breach isn't a proof of concept — it's 150GB of government data, 10 agencies, 195M taxpayer records, extracted using Claude Code and ChatGPT as the primary tools. Combined with the ClawJacked OpenClaw vuln and last week's Claude Code CVEs, the pattern is undeniable: AI coding tools are now dual-use weapons.

3. **The agent security crisis is accelerating faster than patches.** Three major agent security events in 48 hours: Claude Code weaponized in Mexico, ClawJacked hitting OpenClaw via WebSocket, and 71 malicious skills on ClawHub. The ecosystem of agent tools, skills, and configs is the new supply chain attack surface — and it's mostly unaudited.

**Counter-narrative:** Vitalik Buterin publicly stated AI vibe coding could accelerate Ethereum's roadmap "much faster than people expect." The optimistic camp is getting louder even as the security camp sounds alarms. The tension between "ship fast with AI" and "AI tools are attack vectors" will define the next 6 months.

## 🚀 Top Early Moves (CONFIRMED, last 24h)

### 1) US military used Claude in Iran strikes despite Trump's ban
- The Wall Street Journal reports that the Pentagon used Anthropic's Claude AI during Saturday's strikes on Iran — mere hours after Trump directed all federal agencies to cease using Anthropic products. Defense officials told Axios the ban was "still being processed through procurement channels" when the strikes launched. Claude was already embedded in targeting and planning workflows that couldn't be swapped out in real-time.
- Why it matters: this is the strongest proof yet that frontier AI is critical military infrastructure. Vendor switching is no longer a procurement decision — it's an operational risk. If you're building on any AI API, your vendor's political exposure is your business continuity risk.

### 2) Hackers weaponize Claude Code to breach 10 Mexican government agencies — 150GB stolen
- Gambit Security disclosed a cyberattack where hackers used Claude Code and ChatGPT to develop exploits, create custom tools, and automatically exfiltrate 150GB+ of data from 10 Mexican government bodies and a financial institution. Data includes 195 million taxpayer records, voting records, and government employee databases. The attack chain started with Mexico's tax authority in late December and expanded using AI-generated tooling.
- Why it matters: first confirmed large-scale government breach where AI coding agents were the primary offensive tool. The attacker jailbroke Claude to write exploits and automate data extraction — exactly the workflow practitioners use for legitimate work, repurposed for offense.

### 3) ClawJacked: OpenClaw WebSocket hijack + 71 malicious ClawHub skills
- Oasis Security disclosed "ClawJacked" — a vulnerability where malicious websites could open WebSocket connections to OpenClaw's localhost gateway (TCP 18789) and brute-force the gateway password. Separately, 71 malicious skills on ClawHub were found distributing Atomic Stealer (macOS info-stealer). OpenClaw also patched a log poisoning vulnerability. All issues are now fixed.
- Why it matters: **if you run OpenClaw, update immediately.** The WebSocket attack could be triggered by simply visiting a malicious website. The ClawHub supply chain attack mirrors npm/PyPI malware campaigns — agent skill marketplaces are the new attack surface.

- IOCs: IP `91.92.242[.]30` (Atomic Stealer), domain `openclawcli.vercel[.]app`, actor `@liuhui1010` on ClawHub

### 4) GPT-5.4 accidentally leaked in Codex demo
- Multiple sources report that GPT-5.4 appeared in the Codex app model selector during an OpenAI employee's demo. Screenshots from users Emilz and am.will were corroborated by a screen share from OpenAI's Tibo on X. No official announcement from OpenAI — this appears to be an internal model that was briefly visible.
- Why it matters: confirms OpenAI is iterating rapidly past GPT-5.3 (which just launched with Codex on Feb 26). If 5.4 ships soon, the model release cadence is accelerating to monthly increments.

### 5) Alibaba's OpenSandbox rockets to #1 on GitHub trending (1,179 ★/day)
- Alibaba open-sourced OpenSandbox — a general-purpose sandbox platform for AI agent code execution. Multi-language SDKs, Docker/Kubernetes runtimes, designed specifically for coding agents (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor), GUI agents, agent evaluation, and RL training.
- Why it matters: secure code execution for AI agents is an unsolved infrastructure problem. OpenSandbox gives you production-grade sandboxing with one Docker command. Combined with today's security stories, this couldn't be better timed.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Tips

### 1) Check if your OpenClaw is patched against ClawJacked
The ClawJacked vulnerability lets any malicious website connect to your local OpenClaw gateway. Check your version and update:

```bash
# Check your OpenClaw version
openclaw --version

# Update to latest (includes ClawJacked + log poisoning fixes)
npm update -g openclaw

# Verify gateway isn't exposed beyond localhost
lsof -i :18789 | grep LISTEN

# Check for suspicious WebSocket connections from browser processes
lsof -i :18789 | grep -E '(Chrome|Firefox|Safari|Arc)'

# Audit installed skills for known malicious patterns
find ~/.openclaw/skills -name "*.md" -exec grep -l 'curl.*91\.92\.242' {} +
find ~/.openclaw/skills -name "*.sh" -exec grep -l 'openclawcli\.vercel' {} +
```

### 2) Sandbox AI-generated code before execution with OpenSandbox
Given today's Mexico breach and security stories, sandbox untrusted code execution:

```bash
# Quick start with Alibaba OpenSandbox (Docker)
docker run -d --name opensandbox \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  alibaba/opensandbox:latest

# Python SDK — execute AI-generated code in isolation
pip install opensandbox-sdk

# Example: sandbox a Claude Code output before running locally
from opensandbox import SandboxClient

client = SandboxClient("http://localhost:8080")
sandbox = client.create(image="python:3.12-slim", timeout=30)

result = sandbox.execute("""
# paste AI-generated code here for safe execution
import os
print(os.getcwd())  # runs in sandbox, not your machine
""")
print(result.stdout)
sandbox.destroy()
```

## ⚙️ Workflow Upgrades

1. **Update OpenClaw immediately and audit your installed skills.** The ClawJacked fix is in the latest release. Run `openclaw gateway restart` after updating. Then scan your `~/.openclaw/skills/` directory for any skills you don't recognize — 71 malicious ones were found on ClawHub distributing Atomic Stealer on macOS.

2. **Add code sandboxing to your AI agent pipeline.** Between the Mexico breach (Claude Code used offensively) and the Claude Code CVEs from last week, running AI-generated code directly on your machine is increasingly risky. OpenSandbox or similar Docker-based sandboxing should be a default step before any `exec` from an AI agent touches your local environment.

## 🎯 Action Pack (today)

1. **Update OpenClaw NOW** — `npm update -g openclaw && openclaw gateway restart`. Check for malicious skills with the audit commands above. Takes 3 minutes.

2. **Try Alibaba OpenSandbox** — `docker run -d alibaba/opensandbox:latest`. Test it with your next Claude Code or Copilot output before running locally. 15-minute spike.

3. **Watch Jenny Wen's Lenny's Podcast episode** — Head of design at Anthropic on how AI changes the design-to-code pipeline. Directly relevant to SaaS team structure.

4. **Review your AI vendor dependencies** — After today's Iran/Claude story, assess: if your primary AI vendor got blacklisted tomorrow, how fast could you switch? Document your model-specific dependencies and test at least one fallback.

5. **Explore claude-scientific-skills (K-Dense-AI)** — Trending on GitHub. Pre-built agent skills for research, science, engineering, and finance. If you use Claude Code with the skills system, these are drop-in ready.
