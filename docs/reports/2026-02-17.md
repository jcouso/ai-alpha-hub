## 🧭 Narrative Radar

### What's Shifting This Week

**1. The AI Backlash Has Teeth Now**
This isn't just vibes anymore. The Pentagon is threatening to blacklist Anthropic — a label "usually reserved for foreign adversaries" — because Claude's AUP restricts military use. GitHub had to add a nuclear option (disable PRs entirely) because AI slop is drowning open source maintainers. Jeff Geerling's viral "AI is destroying Open Source" essay catalyzed the anger. The "Token Anxiety" essay on HN (115 pts) nails the psychological toll: coding agents are slot machines, and developers are developing gambling patterns. The counter-narrative is getting organized.

**2. Chinese AI Labs Ship While Everyone Else Talks**
Qwen 3.5 dropped Feb 16 with a genuinely novel architecture (Gated Delta Networks + sparse MoE), open weights, and claims of beating frontier US models on multiple benchmarks. Meanwhile ByteDance is getting sued over Seedance 2.0's quality being *too good* at copying Hollywood IP. The gap isn't narrowing — on some dimensions, Chinese labs are pulling ahead, especially on cost efficiency and open-weights distribution.

**3. India Emerges as AI Battleground**
Every major CEO (Altman, Pichai, Amodei, Huang, Ambani) is in Delhi for the AI Impact Summit. India has 100M weekly ChatGPT users, is Claude's #2 market, and just allocated $1.1B for AI VC. Anthropic's India revenue doubled in 4 months. This isn't a side market anymore — it's a front in the AI platform war.

### What's Fading
- The "developers stopped coding" discourse is maturing into nuanced takes (Token Anxiety, Steve Yegge) instead of hype
- Single-tool loyalty (the "Cursor vs Claude Code" debates) — VS Code 1.109 multi-agent orchestration makes the IDE less important than the model

## 🚀 Top Early Moves

### 1. Qwen 3.5 — Open-Weights Agentic Frontier Model 🔥🔥
**Score: 9/10** | Fresh (Feb 16) + Deep + Actionable

Alibaba released Qwen3.5-397B-A17B: 397B total parameters, only 17B active per forward pass (sparse MoE). Hybrid architecture combines Gated Delta Networks (linear attention) with sparse MoE for 8-19x faster inference than predecessors. Native multimodal (text + vision from first pretraining stage), 256K context (open), 1M context (Plus hosted). 201 languages, 87.8 MMLU-Pro. Three runtime modes: thinking, fast, auto.

**Why it matters:** Open-weights model claiming to match frontier closed models at a fraction of the cost. If benchmarks hold, this could be the best open-source model for agentic workflows. The Gated Delta Networks architecture is novel — worth understanding.

### 2. Pentagon Threatens Anthropic as "Supply Chain Risk" 🔥
**Score: 8.5/10** | Fresh (Feb 16) + High impact on Claude users

Defense Secretary Hegseth is "close" to cutting Anthropic's $200M DoD contract and designating the company a "supply chain risk" — a label usually reserved for foreign adversaries like Huawei. The trigger: Claude's acceptable use policy restricts military applications, and the Pentagon wants "all lawful use" standard that OpenAI, Google, and xAI accept.

**Why it matters:** If designated, every company doing business with the Pentagon would need to certify they don't use Claude. That's a massive chilling effect on enterprise adoption. It also signals the US government is weaponizing procurement policy to pressure AI companies on safety policies.

### 3. AGENTS.md Files Actually Hurt Coding Agents 🔥
**Score: 8.5/10** | Directly relevant to your workflow

New arxiv paper (110 pts on HN today): researchers evaluated AGENTS.md-style context files across multiple coding agents and LLMs. Findings: context files **reduce** task success rates compared to no context, while increasing inference cost by over 20%. Both LLM-generated and developer-written context files encourage "broader exploration" (more testing, more file traversal) but make tasks harder via unnecessary requirements.

**Key quote:** "Human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements."

**Why it matters:** You use AGENTS.md daily. This is a direct signal to audit yours — trim it to minimal, essential instructions. Less is more.

---

### 4. GitHub's "Eternal September" + Disable PRs Feature
**Score: 8/10** | Infrastructure shift for open source

GitHub published an official blog acknowledging the AI slop crisis: "Open source is experiencing its own Eternal September." They shipped two new settings (Feb 13): **disable pull requests entirely** and **restrict PRs to collaborators only**. Jeff Geerling's viral companion piece (Feb 16) documents the ground reality: curl dropped bug bounties (useful reports went from 15% → 5%), Ars Technica retracted an AI-hallucinated article, and maintainers of 300+ repos are overwhelmed.

**Why it matters:** The fundamental mechanism that made GitHub popular (open PRs) is being turned off. This will reshape how open source works. If you maintain OSS repos, enable these settings now.

### 5. claude-devtools — See Everything Claude Code Hides
**Score: 7.5/10** | Immediately actionable for Claude Code users

Show HN today: a desktop app that reconstructs Claude Code sessions from raw logs in ~/.claude/. Shows every file path, tool call, diff, and token — everything the CLI's opaque "Read 3 files. Edited 2 files." summaries hide. Free, open source, no API keys, works on macOS (Apple Silicon + Intel), Linux, Windows, Docker.

**Why it matters:** If you use Claude Code daily and have been frustrated by the dumbed-down output, this gives you full visibility without --verbose noise. Install it.

## 🎬 Video & Image AI

### Disney vs. Seedance 2.0 — Copyright War Escalates
Disney sent a cease-and-desist calling ByteDance's Seedance a "virtual smash-and-grab" of their IP. Paramount Skydance, MPA, SAG-AFTRA all followed. Japan launched an investigation. ByteDance pledged safeguards but gave no details. Meanwhile, Disney has a $1B deal with OpenAI's Sora for the same characters.

**Why it matters:** The template is forming: if you're American (Sora), you get a deal; if you're Chinese (Seedance), you get sued. This will define the AI video market for years.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Tips

### Trim Your AGENTS.md to Minimum
The arxiv paper is clear: verbose context files hurt more than help. Audit your AGENTS.md:
- Remove anything the agent would figure out from the codebase anyway
- Keep only: build commands, test commands, key architectural decisions, critical constraints
- Remove: style preferences the linter enforces, obvious patterns, long explanations

### claude-devtools for Session Debugging
```bash
# Install on macOS
brew install --cask claude-devtools
# Or download from GitHub
open https://github.com/matt1398/claude-devtools/releases/latest
```
Reads ~/.claude/ session logs. Zero config. See every file read, tool call, and token consumed.

### FreeFlow — Free Voice-to-Text for Coding
Open-source Wispr Flow alternative by zachlatta (Hack Club founder). Context-aware dictation that reads your current app context. Uses free Groq API, no server, privacy-friendly.

```bash

## ⚙️ Workflow Upgrades

### Zed Editor Headless Mode for AI Agents
Nathan Sobo merged headless platform (PR #46758) — Zed can now run without a GUI, driven programmatically by AI agents. Agents get full editor semantics: Tree-sitter parsing, LSP integration, diagnostics, code actions, multi-buffer editing. No more "reading files and parsing text output."

**Why it matters:** This is the Playwright moment for code editors. Expect agent frameworks to adopt Zed as a common runtime.

### Copilot CLI Hits Production-Ready Alt-Screen Mode
7 releases in 10 days (v0.0.404-v0.0.410). Alt-screen buffer is now default — mouse text selection, scrollable permission prompts, full-screen diffs. The terminal agent experience just leveled up.

## 🎯 Action Pack

1. **Audit your AGENTS.md** — The research is in: less is more. Trim to essential build/test commands and critical constraints only.

2. **Install claude-devtools** — If you use Claude Code, get visibility back. Free, zero config, immediate value.

3. **Test Qwen 3.5 on OpenRouter** — The `enable_auto` adaptive mode is worth evaluating. At 17B active params, inference costs should be very competitive.

4. **Enable PR restrictions on your OSS repos** — GitHub's new settings are live. Settings > General > Features. Protect yourself from AI slop.

5. **Try FreeFlow** — Free voice dictation with context awareness. Good for prompting agents while doing something else.
