# AI Alpha Report — 2026-02-28

## TL;DR
- GitHub just made **Claude + Codex available to Copilot Business/Pro**, which is a real model-choice unlock for existing enterprise teams.
- **Copilot CLI is GA**, pushing agentic coding deeper into terminal-native workflows.
- Open-source agent infra got practical fast: **obra/superpowers** (workflow discipline) + **Alibaba OpenSandbox** (execution isolation).
- Biggest practical alpha today: **Unsloth Dynamic 2.0 for Qwen 3.5** makes local/self-hosted reasoning setups much cheaper and faster.
- No newly verified frontier text model launch in this 24h window.

## 🧭 Narrative Radar
1. **Distribution > model novelty (today):** shipping into existing surfaces (GitHub, design/dev workflows) is beating raw model-launch hype.
2. **Agent hardening is becoming productized:** teams are moving from “agents are risky” to “ship with sandbox + policy layers by default.”
3. **Open model practicality is improving:** the focus is shifting from “can open models compete?” to “can they run cheaply enough in production?”

## 🧪 Research Frontier
- **Unsloth Dynamic 2.0 (Qwen 3.5 quantization):** early technical evidence that better quantization is turning “good open models” into actually deployable local stacks.
  - Source: https://unsloth.ai/docs/basics/unsloth-dynamic-2.0-ggufs
- **A2A infrastructure trend (emerging):** Confluent adding A2A support suggests multi-agent messaging is becoming infra-native, not framework-only.
  - Source: https://news.google.com/rss/articles/CBMivgFBVV95cUxNUUtJcjgzNmFfWW92bEIxQm95eEVfQUt6d280b1RVclVPTGFYdVM1TTVhb21uTFJaUTB2S19kVWw0R0dpOE5mUUk2Z1BJMXJaanJrUVNfQkFVY2NHeXVZbXBqaEZoMUlfc2puN252eEVfbkFFLVlORW1iU3Q1WkxvaFgxNjMwcHNQbVp3YzVyZmNkckRMVHNoMGFWUzBYQmhDOFlldkhnV09pSlFnb0NhcTBlQ2RCVVA3Tlpxb3dn?oc=5
- **Watch item:** AGENTS.md-overload performance claims are still interesting, but not strongly verified with a primary paper link in this run.

## 🎬 Video & Image AI
- No newly verified launch from Sora/Veo/Kling/Runway/Pika/Midjourney/Flux/SD in this strict window.
- The practical item still worth tracking: **Nano Banana 2 rollout** in Google channels (image generation/editing).

## 🤖 New Models & Benchmarks (VERIFIED ONLY)
- **No newly verified frontier text model release in the last 24h.**
- Practical benchmark-related movement today is mostly around deployment efficiency (quantization/runtime), not net-new model launches.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Tips

### 1) Add a fast guardrail check before agent runs (repo-level)
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

# Block risky agent hook files before CI/agent execution
if find . -type f \( -path "*/.claude/*" -o -name "AGENTS.md" -o -name "SKILL.md" \) \
  | xargs -I{} sh -c 'rg -n "(curl |wget |bash -c|python -c|rm -rf)" "{}" && echo "Risky pattern in {}"' ; then
  echo "⚠️ Review agent context/hook files before running coding agents."
fi
```

### 2) Quick local benchmark harness for quantized open-model checks
```python
# pip install requests
import time, requests

URL = "http://localhost:11434/api/generate"  # Ollama-compatible local endpoint
payload = {
    "model": "qwen3.5:dynamic-q4",  # example dynamic quant tag
    "prompt": "Refactor this function for readability and add tests.",
    "stream": False,
}

start = time.time()
res = requests.post(URL, json=payload, timeout=120)
print("status:", res.status_code, "latency_s:", round(time.time()-start, 2))
print(res.json().get("response", "")[:400])
```

## ⚙️ Workflow Upgrades
1. Add a **model-routing rule** in your team docs: use Claude/Codex for complex diffs, cheaper local quantized model for broad refactors.
2. Add an **agent sandbox-by-default policy**: no untrusted repo execution without isolated runtime + file/network restrictions.

---

## 🎯 Action Pack (today)
1. Enable Claude/Codex in your Copilot org and run one side-by-side task benchmark.
2. Install/verify Copilot CLI in one production repo and script 3 repetitive terminal tasks.
3. Clone and test `obra/superpowers` on a small feature branch.
4. Run one quantized Qwen 3.5 local benchmark with Dynamic 2.0 and compare cost/latency vs your current API path.
5. Add a pre-run security check for `.claude/`, `AGENTS.md`, and `SKILL.md` files in CI.
