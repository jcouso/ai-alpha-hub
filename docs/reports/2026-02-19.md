## 🧭 Narrative Radar

### What's Shifting This Week

**1. Anthropic's Identity Crisis: Safety Company vs. Business Survival**
Two stories colliding in real-time. On one front, the Pentagon is threatening to sever its contract and declare Anthropic a "supply chain risk" because they won't lift safety restrictions on Claude for military operations. On the other, Anthropic is quietly locking down OAuth tokens to prevent third-party tools from using Claude subscriptions — almost certainly because Max subscribers are consuming far more than the $200/month covers. The irony: the company founded to be the "responsible AI" lab is now simultaneously too restrictive for the military and too restrictive for its own paying users. Meanwhile, Dario Amodei is opening a Bengaluru office and courting India. Anthropic is being pulled in every direction.

**2. The Platform Lock-In Backlash Has Arrived**
The Claude Max OAuth lockdown is pushing the entire OpenClaw community toward OpenAI's Codex subscription. Multiple blog posts and tutorials dropped within hours showing how to switch. The lesson for any SaaS founder: when you build on someone else's subscription model, you're one TOS change away from losing your product. Open Code (open-source Claude Code alternative) is gaining traction as the "never get rug-pulled again" option.

**3. Hollywood Unites Against AI Video — Speed Is Unprecedented**
Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros., Netflix, and now Sony — all five major studios have sent cease-and-desist letters to ByteDance over Seedance 2.0 within ~2 weeks. Netflix's language was the sharpest: "high-speed piracy engine." This is the fastest unified studio response to any tech threat in Hollywood history. The copyright wall around AI-generated video content is going up fast.

### What's Fading
- The "OpenClaw security meltdown" narrative from last week is being overshadowed by the OAuth/Anthropic business story
- India AI Summit generated lots of investment announcements but no breakthrough products

## 🚀 Top Early Moves

### 1. Anthropic Blocks Claude Max OAuth for Third-Party Tools 🔥🔥🔥
**Score: 9.5/10** | URGENT — Directly affects your setup

Anthropic updated their Claude Code docs to explicitly state: OAuth tokens from Free, Pro, and Max plans are "intended exclusively for Claude Code and Claude.ai" and using them in "any other product, tool, or service — including the Agent SDK" violates the Consumer TOS.

**What's happening on the ground:**
- OpenClaw users reporting OAuth errors after Sonnet 4.6 rollout
- Multiple blog posts already showing how to switch OpenClaw to GPT-5.3-Codex
- Anthropic's Tariq (DevRel) called it a "doc cleanup" but won't confirm whether OpenClaw specifically is affected
- The community consensus: OpenClaw is clearly a third-party tool, don't wait for confirmation
- Kimi K2.5 (Moonshot AI) gaining users as a cost-effective alternative (10-14x cheaper than Opus)
- Open Code (open-source Claude Code) getting traction as a multi-model alternative

**Your options:**
1. **Switch OpenClaw to Codex** — `openclaw onboard --auth-choice openai-codex` → choose "Use existing values" → `openclaw models set openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex`
2. **Use Anthropic API key** (pay-per-token) — `openclaw onboard --auth-choice anthropic` via console.anthropic.com
3. **Wait** — but risk account suspension

### 2. Pentagon vs. Anthropic Escalates to "Supply Chain Risk" Threat ⚔️
**Score: 8.5/10** | Industry-shaping, affects enterprise Claude adoption

The Pentagon is threatening to declare Anthropic a "supply chain risk" — a designation normally reserved for foreign adversaries — because the company won't lift safety restrictions on Claude for military operations. Axios reports this is pushing other AI labs (OpenAI, Google, xAI) into a dilemma: how far will they bend their own safety policies for defense contracts?

**Why this matters beyond headlines:** Claude is "widely integrated across the department" per NYT. If the Pentagon actually follows through, it creates enterprise procurement uncertainty for Anthropic. For builders, this is a signal: Anthropic's safety stance is both their brand and their business risk. If you're building products on Claude, watch this closely.

### 3. OpenAI EVMbench — AI for Smart Contract Security 🔐
**Score: 7.5/10** | New benchmark, shows Codex 5.3 capabilities

OpenAI and Paradigm launched EVMbench: 120 curated vulnerabilities from 40 audits, testing AI agents on three modes — detect, patch, and exploit smart contract vulnerabilities. Key result: GPT-5.3-Codex scores 72.2% on exploit mode vs. GPT-5's 31.9% from six months ago.

**Interesting insight from the benchmark:** Agents are best at *exploiting* (clear objective: drain funds) but weaker at *detecting* (tend to stop after finding one issue) and *patching* (maintaining functionality while removing bugs is hard). This pattern likely generalizes to other coding agent tasks.

### 4. Claude Opus 4.6 Now in GitHub Copilot Everywhere 🤖
**Score: 7.0/10** | Actionable for Copilot users

GitHub Changelog (Feb 18): Claude Opus 4.6 is GA in Copilot for VS Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, Xcode, and Eclipse. Available to Enterprise, Business, Pro, and Pro+ plans. Business/Enterprise admins must opt in via policy settings.

Also: **Copilot coding agent now supports Windows projects** — configure via `copilot-setup-steps.yml` with custom `runs-on` setting. Note: integrated firewall isn't compatible with Windows, so self-hosted runners recommended.

### 5. Qodo 2.1: AI-Driven Rules System for Code Review
**Score: 7.0/10** | Practical tool upgrade

Qodo shipped version 2.1 with an intelligent Rules System that auto-generates coding standards from your codebase, enforces them during PR review, and learns from your decisions over time. Replaces static rule files with a dynamic system. Compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline — uses the open Agent Skills standard.

They also shipped Agent Skills for auto-fixing PR issues — integrate into any coding agent's workflow.

### 6. Gen + Vercel Partner on AI Skills Safety Verification
**Score: 7.5/10** | Directly relevant to OpenClaw/skills security from yesterday's report

Gen (Norton/Avast parent) partnered with Vercel to launch independent safety ratings for AI skills at [skills.sh](https://skills.sh). Gen's Agent Trust Hub analyzes skills for security weaknesses, unsafe permissions, and malicious intent, giving each skill a clear verification rating.

**Why this matters:** Yesterday's report covered the ClawHavoc attack (1,184 malicious skills on ClawHub). This is the ecosystem's response. If you install skills for Claude Code, OpenClaw, or any agent, this rating system is the trust layer that was missing.

## 🎬 Video & Image AI

### Seedance 2.0 Legal Pile-On Intensifies — Sony Makes It 5/5 Studios
**Score: 8.0/10** | All major Hollywood studios now targeting ByteDance

Sony Pictures is the fifth and final major studio to send a cease-and-desist letter to ByteDance over Seedance 2.0. Netflix's letter was the sharpest, calling it a "high-speed piracy engine" generating "mass quantities of unauthorized derivative works." ByteDance's response — "We are taking steps to strengthen current safeguards" — was deemed "not good enough" by every subsequent studio.

This is unprecedented speed for a coordinated Hollywood legal response. The copyright battle around AI video tools is now a full industry-wide offensive.

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Tips

### Switch OpenClaw to Codex NOW (If You're on Claude Max OAuth)
If you're using OpenClaw with a Claude Max subscription, switch before you get locked out:

```bash
# Full sequence (5 minutes)
openclaw onboard --auth-choice openai-codex
# → Choose Quickstart
# → Choose "Use existing values" (DO NOT reset)
# → Authenticate in browser
# → Close terminal after auth

openclaw models set openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
openclaw models status --plain
```

Your workspace, memory, cron jobs, skills, and channels all stay intact. Only the model changes.

### Qodo Agent Skills for Auto-Fixing PRs
