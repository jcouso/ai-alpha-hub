AI Alpha briefing for February seventeenth, twenty twenty six.

Here is the short version of what actually matters today.

First, Alibaba released Qwen three point five, an open model aimed at agent workflows. Early signals suggest it is fast, multimodal, and strong enough to pressure closed model pricing.

Second, the Pentagon is threatening to classify Anthropic as a supply chain risk because of military usage restrictions in Claude policy. If that escalates, it could affect enterprise adoption around government contracts.

Third, a new research paper says long AGENTS dot M D files can hurt coding agent performance instead of helping. The practical takeaway is simple: keep agent instructions short and only include critical constraints.

Fourth, GitHub publicly acknowledged the flood of low quality AI pull requests and shipped stronger controls for maintainers. That is a real workflow shift for open source teams.

And fifth, legal pressure on video generation is getting much more aggressive, with Disney and other major media groups pushing hard against Seedance outputs. Expect tighter enforcement and more licensing battles.

For today, run three actions.

One: test Qwen three point five on a real task in your stack.

Two: trim your AGENTS dot M D to essential instructions only.

Three: lock down pull request permissions in any public repo you maintain.
