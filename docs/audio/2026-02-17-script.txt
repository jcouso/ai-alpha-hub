AI Alpha audio briefing for February 17, 2026.

Here are today's key signals in under three minutes.

Top headlines:

1. Qwen 3.5 dropped — 397B MoE (17B active), open weights, 8-19x faster inference, native multimodal, designed for "agentic AI era"

2. Pentagon threatens to label Anthropic a "supply chain risk" — $200M contract at stake, Claude's military restrictions trigger retaliation

3. Research: AGENTS.md files actually hurt coding agents — arxiv paper shows they reduce success rates and increase cost 20%

4. GitHub's Eternal September — PRs can now be disabled entirely; Jeff Geerling says AI is destroying open source

Most actionable moves:

1. Qwen 3.5 — Open-Weights Agentic Frontier Model

2. Pentagon Threatens Anthropic as "Supply Chain Risk"

3. AGENTS.md Files Actually Hurt Coding Agents

Next actions for today:

1. Audit your AGENTS.md — The research is in: less is more. Trim to essential build/test commands and critical constraints only.

2. Install claude-devtools — If you use Claude Code, get visibility back. Free, zero config, immediate value.
