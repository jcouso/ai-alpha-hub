*Research Frontier* 🔬
- No major new frontier paper in strict 24h from tracked official lab channels.
- But two high-signal frontier shifts:
  - *Roundtrip code↔design* is becoming real product infra (OpenAI+Figma MCP).
  - *Agent self-critique loops* are becoming mainstream (GitHub coding agent self-review), which changes how we should eval agent quality.

---
*What this means (straight)*
- Distribution + integration is beating raw model hype.
- If your stack is GitHub-first, this is a good week to operationalize multi-agent workflows.
- Governance (policies/auditability) is now mandatory, not “later.”
