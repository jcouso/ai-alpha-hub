🔥 *#1 — Superpowers: 60K★, #1 on GitHub*
obra/superpowers exploded to 59,929 stars (1,500/day). A complete agentic dev workflow — brainstorming → spec → TDD → subagent-driven dev → code review — that installs in one command for Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex. Skills trigger automatically. Your coding agent just gets superpowers.
→ `/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace`

🇨🇳 *#2 — DeepSeek Trained on Banned Nvidia Chips*
Reuters exclusive: China's DeepSeek used Nvidia's latest chips despite US export ban. New model imminent. CNBC warns of "rough period for Nasdaq stocks" when it drops. Export controls failing.

📝 *#3 — Simon Willison: "Writing Code Is Cheap Now"*
Landmark post + new project documenting "Agentic Engineering Patterns." Key thesis: code is cheap now, and every engineering habit — planning, estimation, code review — needs to evolve. HN 214 pts.

🖥️ *#4 — AI Builds FreeBSD Wi-Fi Driver (HN #1, 385 pts)*
Someone got AI to build a working kernel Wi-Fi driver for an old MacBook on FreeBSD. After Ladybird's Rust port and IBM COBOL: AI coding agents are now credible in systems programming.

📉 *#5 — IBM Crash Deepens to 13% ("Worst Since 2000")*
Reuters: "steepest daily drop since 2000." Forrester calls it a "SaaS-pocalypse in cybersecurity." The market is pricing in AI agents as existential threats to tech services.

🎬 *#6 — Theo: "Anthropic Is Lying to Us"*
Fresh today. Challenges Anthropic's distillation attack claims. After yesterday's "Delete your CLAUDE.md" — Theo is on a streak of provocative counter-takes.

🧪 *#7 — "Car Wash" Test: 42 of 53 Models Fail*
"Should I walk or drive to the car wash?" — only 5 models pass reliably (10/10): Claude Opus 4.6, Gemini 3 Flash/Pro, Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite, Grok-4. GPT-5 fails 30% of the time.

🧠 *#8 — Steerling-8B: First Interpretable LLM*
Show HN at 190 pts. Can explain which part of the prompt caused each output token. From Guide Labs (MIT/UMD/MILA PhDs). Early but potentially transformative for AI auditing.

⚔️ *#9 — Grok Gets Pentagon Classified Systems Deal*
Axios: xAI signed deal for Grok in classified systems. Same week as Anthropic CEO Pentagon meeting. Defense AI market heating up fast.

🧬 *#10 — Anthropic: Why AI Acts Human ("Persona Selection Model")*
New research paper. Key insight: you're not talking to the AI — you're talking to a "persona" (character) that pretraining created. Context engineering literally shapes which persona your agent embodies.
