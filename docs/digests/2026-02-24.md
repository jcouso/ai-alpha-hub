🔮 *AI Alpha — Feb 24, 2026*

The AI defense race splits into camps, Theo goes nuclear on Anthropic, DeepSeek breaks through export controls, and the skills ecosystem explodes.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*🔥 LEAD: The AI Defense Complex Fractures*

xAI/Grok just signed a deal to enter Pentagon classified systems (Axios). Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Hegseth summoned Anthropic's CEO for "tough talks" about military use of Claude. Two days after Anthropic accused DeepSeek of distillation attacks.

The camps: xAI (all-in defense), Anthropic (under pressure), OpenAI/MSFT (existing DoD). Your API provider's gov posture now affects your compliance story.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*📺 Theo: "Anthropic is lying to us"*

Third consecutive day of Theo (1M+ devs) on Claude. This one goes past workflow into trust. Combined with "Delete your CLAUDE.md" yesterday → major narrative shift in dev community.

*🇨🇳 DeepSeek Trained on Nvidia's Best Chip Despite US Ban*

Reuters exclusive: officials confirm DeepSeek used Nvidia's top chips despite export controls. New model "imminent" (CNBC). Combined with Anthropic's distillation allegations → DeepSeek is THE flashpoint of US-China AI confrontation.

Meanwhile: *Qwen 3.5 397B-A17* beats Alibaba's own trillion-param model at a fraction of cost (VentureBeat). MoE efficiency thesis proven.

*🔬 Show HN Highlights*

• *Steerling-8B* (192 pts) — First LM that can explain any token: traces output to input context, human concepts, AND training data. Concept-level steering at inference time without retraining. guidelabs.ai

• *enveil* (105 pts) — Encrypt .env secrets from AI coding tools. Your Claude Code/Copilot/Cursor can snoop your API keys. Fix in 5 min:
`cargo install enveil && enveil init`

• *Firefox 148* (302 pts) — "AI Kill Switch": disable all AI features permanently. Future updates won't override.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

*💼 Industry Moves*

• OpenAI Codex hired *Cursor co-founder Rohan Varma* for agent dev environments
• *Mistral AI acquired Koyeb* (serverless platform) → building full-stack AI cloud
• *Wolfram Language* pitched as "foundation tool for LLMs" — computation backbone for agents (stephenwolfram.com)
• *Claude Code Security* causing "SaaS-pocalypse" in cybersecurity stocks (Forrester)

*🧪 Research Frontier*

📄 *Navigation Paradox in Agentic Code Intelligence* (arXiv)
Agents fail on large codebases not from context limits — navigation ≠ retrieval. CodeCompass MCP server (dependency graphs) dramatically improves performance. → If your agent struggles with big repos, expose the dependency graph.

📄 *Interaction Theater: LLM Agents at Scale* (arXiv)
800K posts from AI-only social platform Moltbook. Finding: 65% of agent comments share NO content with the post they reply to. 28% spam, 22% off-topic. → Multi-agent communication is mostly noise. Surface metrics are deceiving.

📄 *Latent Introspection: Models Detect Concept Injections* (arXiv)
Qwen 32B can detect prompt manipulation in its residual stream — but denies it in outputs. Models "know" they're being manipulated even when they comply.
