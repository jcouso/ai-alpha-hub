⚡ AI Alpha · Monday Feb 23

🧭 Narrative: Human-directed AI ("centaur") is winning. The era of plumbing for agents has arrived — sandboxes, memory, security scanning, P2P comms — while platforms start fighting back against third-party orchestrators.

🔥 Ladybird Browser adopts Rust via Claude Code + Codex: 25K lines ported in 2 weeks, zero regressions across 65K tests. Best public proof yet of AI-accelerated codebase modernization.

🚨 Google restricting AI Pro/Ultra accounts for using OpenClaw with Gemini (without warning). Platform risk for multi-model gateways is real — Google is locking down OAuth access to protect subscription revenue.

📉 JFrog -25% after Claude Code Security launch — AI-native security scanning disrupting DevSecOps vendors.

🎬 Theo: "Delete your CLAUDE.md" — argues agent config file proliferation is an anti-pattern.

📦 Open source surge: ntransformer (Llama 70B on 1×RTX 3090, NVMe direct I/O), Shuru (microVM sandboxing for agents), GitNexus (codebase knowledge graphs as MCP), Cloudflare Agents SDK (persistent stateful agents), memU (24/7 agent memory).

🤗 HuggingFace Skills (1,470⭐/day) — standardized cross-agent skill definitions for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor.

🚨 SkillScan: 14.4% of AI agent skills in ClawHub contain threats. VirusTotal misses them — natural language attacks aren't binary malware.

🧪 arXiv today: Logitext (neurosymbolic reasoning as SMT), OMAD (diffusion policies for multi-agent RL), AI lowering CTF/security barriers for novices.

🤖 No new verified model releases today. Gemini 3.1 Pro > GPT-5 claim circulating — UNVERIFIED, source is Qoo10 (e-commerce site), not Google.

🎙️ Lenny's Podcast: "Don't get stuck using old models" (Feb 23) — directly relevant to model selection for your stack.

📺 Theo: "Delete your CLAUDE.md (and your AGENT.md too)" → youtube.com/watch?v=GcNu6wrLTJc (Feb 23)

🧑‍💻 Tip: For AI-assisted language migrations, Ladybird's method works: human decides scope + order, agent translates, adversarial review passes catch subtle errors, run test suite for verification. Compress months → weeks.
