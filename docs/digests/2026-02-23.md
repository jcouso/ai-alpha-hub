*The Distillation War Goes Public*

🔥 *#1 — Anthropic Names DeepSeek, Moonshot & MiniMax in Industrial-Scale Distillation Attack*
Official blog: 3 Chinese labs ran 16M exchanges through 24K fraudulent accounts to extract Claude's agentic reasoning, tool use, and coding capabilities. DeepSeek (150K exchanges) even extracted censorship-safe alternatives to political queries. Moonshot (3.4M exchanges) targeted computer-use agents. MiniMax (13M exchanges) pivoted within 24h when Anthropic released new models. Proxy networks ran 20K+ simultaneous accounts. Simultaneously covered by WSJ, Reuters, NYT, Bloomberg. Pentagon's Hegseth meeting Anthropic CEO (Axios). This is a coordinated move to reshape the export control debate.

🦀 *#2 — Ladybird Browser Adopts Rust — Using Claude Code + Codex*
HN #2 (988 pts). The browser engine ported 25K lines of C++ to Rust using Claude Code and Codex in *2 weeks*. Zero regressions across 52,898 test262 tests. Method: "human-directed, not autonomous" — hundreds of small prompts, then adversarial review with different models. This is the proof that AI-assisted code translation works at enterprise scale.

📉 *#3 — IBM Stock Tanks 11% on Anthropic COBOL Threat*
First major stock crash directly caused by an AI coding tool. Anthropic positions Claude Code for COBOL modernization; IBM's legacy consulting business gets repriced by the market. Bloomberg: "IBM Shares Plunge as Anthropic Touts COBOL Modernization Efforts." If 25K lines of browser engine port in 2 weeks, what does COBOL→Java look like?

🗑️ *#4 — Theo: "Delete your CLAUDE.md (and your AGENT.md too)"*
Fresh today. Provocative counter-take after Boris Tane's structured workflow hit HN #1 yesterday. The dev community splits: maximum structure vs. minimal context. The right answer is project-dependent, but the debate itself shows the space maturing fast.

🤗 *#5 — HuggingFace Skills Explodes (1,470 ⭐/day)*
GitHub #2 trending. Cross-platform skills for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Cursor. The ecosystem standard for packaging agent instructions is crystallizing. From "interesting" yesterday to "ecosystem shift" today.

*📡 More Signals*

🧠 *memU* — Memory framework for 24/7 agents (mentions OpenClaw by name). Treats memory like a file system, reduces token costs. 10K stars.
💬 *Aqua* — P2P encrypted messaging between AI agents (HN 71 pts). E2E encrypted, identity verification, libp2p. "Signal for agents."
☁️ *Cloudflare Agents* — 313⭐/day. Persistent stateful agents on Durable Objects with MCP support. `npm install agents`.
🔬 *ASML EUV breakthrough* — 50% more chips by 2030 (Reuters). AI chip supply keeps improving.
🇨🇳 *Chinese model race* — DeepSeek new model "imminent" (CNBC), GLM-5 + Qwen3.5 reportedly launched (Recode China AI). Both UNVERIFIED.
🎙️ *Boris Cherny* (Claude Code creator) shares 3 principles with every team member (Business Insider)
🎧 *Lenny's Podcast*: "Don't get stuck using old models" (today)

*🔬 Research Frontier*

Context engineering now cited in academic research — Peking U paper references the Agent-Skills-for-Context-Engineering repo (8.8K ⭐) as "foundational work on static skill architecture." The discipline of curating agent context windows is becoming formalized.

P2P agent comms stack emerging: Aqua (encrypted messaging) + Agent Semantic Protocol (intent vectors) + Human Root of Trust (crypto accountability). Early but solving real problems.

memU's "proactive intention capture" — understanding what users are *about to do* — is the research frontier for always-on agents. Shifts agents from reactive to proactive.
