# AI Alpha Weekly — 2026-03-01

### 🧭 Week Narrative
This week confirmed a hard shift from “best model wins” to “best distribution + safest workflow wins.” Apple put agents inside Xcode, GitHub widened model choice inside Copilot tiers, and OpenAI stacked enterprise/government distribution in one burst. The center of gravity moved from demos to default surfaces.

Security also stopped being a side topic and became the story. Claude Code CVEs, Gemini API-key exposure, and ongoing prompt-injection vectors all pointed to the same thing: agent config and integration layers are now production attack surfaces. Teams that treat agent security like AppSec will move faster than teams pretending this is still a prompt-quality problem.

At the strategic layer, AI vendors crossed into explicit geopolitical positioning. Anthropic/OpenAI defense divergence, DeepSeek access controls, and enterprise partnership stacking all signal the same future: model/provider selection is now part technical choice, part policy and supply-chain risk decision.

### 🧪 Test This Week
1) **Pre-run agent config security scan on your active repos**  
```bash
for repo in ~/code/*; do
  [ -d "$repo/.git" ] || continue
  echo "\n== $repo =="
  find "$repo" -type f \( -path "*/.claude/*" -o -name ".mcp.json" -o -name "AGENTS.md" -o -name "CLAUDE.md" -o -path "*/.cursor/*" \) \
    -exec rg -n "(curl |wget |bash -c|python -c|eval |rm -rf|/dev/tcp|base64 -d)" {} + 2>/dev/null || true
done
```  
Expected outcome: immediate visibility into risky hook/config patterns before any agent runs.

2) **Install Superpowers in Claude Code and run one real feature kickoff**  
```bash
/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
/plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
# Then start a fresh task in Claude Code: "help me spec and plan <feature>"
```  
Expected outcome: stricter spec→plan→execution loop with less drift and fewer “vibe coding” failures.

3) **Audit GCP keys for accidental Gemini exposure**  
```bash
gcloud services list --enabled --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID | rg -i "generativelanguage|aiplatform"
gcloud services api-keys list --project YOUR_PROJECT_ID --format='table(uid,displayName,restrictions.apiTargets)'
# Rotate/restrict any browser-exposed key tied to Gemini-capable projects
```  
Expected outcome: closes a high-risk data-exposure path that changed quietly for many projects.

4) **Baseline Copilot CLI in terminal-heavy workflow**  
```bash
gh extension install github/gh-copilot || true
gh copilot explain "why is this command failing: npm run build"
gh copilot suggest "write a bash command to find large files over 200MB"
```  
Expected outcome: quick read on whether terminal-agent assist saves time in your real ops/debug loops.
